1. If power transfer is in progress and
the line is disconnected, intermediate routers have
to update the inPower and outPower values 
through corresponding ports

2. After sense_disconnect a push has to be made for SOC_IN to check SOC status 

3. retransmission bypassed

4. hardcoded SOC value in srtstp_transfer.c(for requesting ER) and stp_process.c(for giving ER)
